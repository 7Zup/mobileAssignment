Small IRC in swift. The purpose of this project is to make a simple two-views application that hosts a public chatroom.

## Build the application

To build the application, download the project as a .zip file and extract it.
Note that the "develop" branch is more advanced than master. "develop" is not pushed on master because it is not finished.

Then, run "pod install" in the main folder to download all the librairies.

Finally, open and run the project using xCode.
